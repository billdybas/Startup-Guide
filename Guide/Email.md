# Email

## Email Provider

Use an email provider. Don't try to run your own email service right off the bat. It's a pain to make sure your server isn't or doesn't end up on a blacklist and will eat up more time than you're willing to give right now.

Popular providers include:
- [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/)
- [Sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com/solutions/email-marketing/)
- [Constant Contact](https://www.constantcontact.com/index.jsp)

## CAN-SPAM

If you're going to send email as a business, you have to comply with the [CAN-SPAM Act](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business). If you're using an email provider, they'll often help you comply (eg. making it easy for people to unsubscribe), but the one gotcha is that you need to include a physical mailing address in your emails. If you don't have an office or co-working space with a mailing address, you'll likely need a PO Box.

You can get a PO Box from:
- [USPS](https://poboxes.usps.com/poboxonline/search/landingPage.do)
- [UPS](https://www.theupsstore.com/mailboxes/business-mailboxes)
